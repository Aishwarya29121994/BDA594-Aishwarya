# Big Data Analytics
Big data accoording to me is a "huge" data sets that are available across the various platform in structured, unstructed and semi-structured platform from various sources such as social media, webpages, links, images, videos, URL, etc. Those all the information present in these platform may be related to one particular subject, but there is no way that from these platform we can extract one information that makes sense to human beings or through which we can arrive at one business decision. Having said that, this issue can be overcome by applying analytics to big data through various tools that will help us to extract meaningfull insights about the vast unorgainzed data which can be used effectively. Hence, Big data analytics is process of collecting data from various sources, cleaning and processing it to analyze and then make an approriate business decision.
